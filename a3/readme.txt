Welcome to my Restaurant API
To start extract project folder
open project
run >npm install   // to download all needed dependencies
run >node serverAPI.js  // to start the server
navigate to localhost:3000 to view homepage

Missing:
save button functionality not working to save any changes made to a restaurant on the server, couldn't get it to work :(
